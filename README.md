# Math Programs and Test

This repository contains three simple Python programs for basic math operations (addition, multiplication, and division). Additionally, there is a test script to verify the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Program Files

1. `program1.py`: have to write your code for addition.
2. `program2.py`: have to write your for multiplication.
3. `program3.py`: have to write your for division.

## Test Script

The test script (`test.py`) is designed to check the correctness of the math programs. It imports the functions from the respective program files and performs tests using predefined input values.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the test script:

1. Make sure all three program files (`program1.py`, `program2.py`, and `program3.py`) are in the same directory as the test script (`test.py`).
2. Execute the test script by running the command:

    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

3. Review the test results for each program. If all tests pass, the programs are working correctly.
