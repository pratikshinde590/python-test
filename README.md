# Math Programs and Test

This repository contains three simple Python programs for basic math operations (addition, multiplication, and division). Additionally, there is a test script to verify the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Program Files

1. `program1.py`: have to write your code for addition.
2. `program2.py`: have to write your for multiplication.
3. `program3.py`: have to write your for division.

## Test Script

The test script (`test1.py`), (`test2.py`), (`test3.py`) are designed to check the correctness of your programs. It imports the functions from the respective program files and performs tests using predefined input values.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the test script:

1. Make sure all three program files (`program1.py`, `program2.py`, and `program3.py`) are in the same directory as the test script (`test1.py`), (`test2.py`), (`test3.py`).
2. For Each program there is 20 marks.
3. Do not make changes in these files (`test1.py`), (`test2.py`), (`test3.py`).
4. Execute the test script by running the command:

    ```bash
    python test1.py
    python test2.py
    python test2.py
    ```

5. Review the test results for each program. If all tests pass, the programs are working correctly.
6. Commit and Push your code to repository so that your test will be subbmitted.
